"""SEC EDGAR adapter - primary filing source (SourceTier.PRIMARY_FILING).

Real implementation pulls company facts (XBRL) from SEC EDGAR's public
`companyfacts` API - no key required, only a descriptive User-Agent. Only
works for companies with a resolved CIK (i.e. SEC registrants).

Mock implementation is used in DEMO_MODE or when a company has no CIK
(e.g. a non-US company like Reliance Industries) or the live call fails.
Mock sources are always source_tier=MOCK, never PRIMARY_FILING, so they can
never be mistaken for a real SEC filing downstream.

            f"Revenue was $85.8 billion for {period_label}, compared to $81.8 billion in the prior-year period, "
            f"an increase of approximately 5%.\n"
            f"Net income was $21.4 billion for {period_label}, representing a diluted earnings per share of $1.40.\n"
            f"Operating margin was approximately 29.6% on a GAAP basis for {period_label}.\n"
            f"Cash and cash equivalents totaled $28.4 billion as of the end of {period_label}.\n\n"
            f"Management's Discussion and Analysis: Revenue growth for {period_label} was driven primarily by "
            f"continued strength in the Services segment and steady demand for flagship hardware products in "
            f"developed markets, partially offset by softer demand in certain emerging markets and unfavorable "
            f"foreign currency movements relative to the prior-year period. Gross margin expanded modestly due "
            f"to a favorable product mix and disciplined cost management across the supply chain.\n\n"
            f"Segment Results: The Americas segment reported net sales growth of approximately 4% year over "
            f"year, while Europe grew approximately 3%. Greater China net sales declined slightly amid "
            f"macroeconomic headwinds and intensifying local competition. The Services segment, which includes "
            f"subscription and platform revenue, grew approximately 12% year over year and carries a "
            f"significantly higher gross margin than the Products segment.\n\n"
            f"Liquidity and Capital Resources: The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, "
            f"marketable securities, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its "
            f"working capital, capital expenditure, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve "
            f"months. The Company returned capital to shareholders during {period_label} through share "
            f"repurchases and dividend payments.\n\n"
            f"Risk Factors: The Company's business, reputation, and results of operations could be materially "
            f"adversely affected by global and regional economic conditions, including inflation, changes in "
            f"interest rates, and currency fluctuations. The Company also faces substantial competition in all "
            f"of the markets in which it operates, and this competition could result in reduced margins and "
            f"loss of market share. The Company's business is subject to risks associated with its complex, "
            f"multi-tiered global supply chain, including component shortages, single-source suppliers, and "
            f"geopolitical disruptions that could affect the Company's ability to manufacture and deliver "
            f"products on time. The Company is also subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny and evolving "
            f"data-privacy, antitrust, and digital-markets legislation in multiple jurisdictions, compliance "
            f"with which could increase operating costs or restrict elements of the Company's business model. "
            f"Cybersecurity incidents affecting the Company or its business partners could result in the loss "
            f"of confidential information, disruption to operations, and reputational harm.\n\n"
            f"Outlook: Management expects continued investment in research and development and in new product "
            f"categories, and anticipates that macroeconomic uncertainty, currency volatility, and competitive "
            f"pressure will remain the primary factors affecting results in upcoming periods.\n"
