# VeriFi - Every Number Has a Story

*(project: Financial Research Agent)*

An agentic financial research system that retrieves multi-source company data, extracts
factual claims, **independently verifies every claim against the original source text**,
flags disagreements between sources, and only then produces a structured research report.

Built as a 3rd-semester OJT project (GenAI track) by Suhrid Marwah and Ashnaa Seth.

## 1. Problem Statement

Financial analysts spend hours manually gathering data from SEC filings, earnings reports,
news, and financial data providers, then cross-checking whether cited numbers actually match
their sources. Errors and mis-citations routinely go undetected because verification doesn't
scale. This project builds an agentic system that automatically retrieves multi-source
financial data, generates a structured report, and **verifies every claim against its cited
source text** - flagging disagreements and assigning transparent confidence scores - so the
report is evidence-based rather than trust-based.

The core design principle: **the report is never trusted just because an LLM generated it.**
Every factual statement in the final report traces back to a `claim_id`, which traces to a
stored `Evidence` span (character offsets into a real, retrieved source document), which was
independently checked by a verification engine that never sees the report itself.

This mirrors the PRD's high-level and low-level design diagrams: `query_planner`,
`research_orchestrator`, `source_retriever` (+ `web_search_adapter` / `financial_api_adapter`
/ `sec_edgar`), `claim_extractor`, `verification_engine` (+ `numeric_matcher` /
`entailment_checker`), `conflict_detector`, `confidence_scorer`, `report_generator`, and a
storage layer with distinct `source` / `claim` / `evidence` / `verification_results` /
`conflicts` / `research_runs` / `reports` tables.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Python 3.11+**, FastAPI, Pydantic v2
- **LLM**: Groq or OpenAI - behind a swappable `LLMProvider`,
  with optional tokens-per-minute pacing for rate-limited free tiers
- **Web search**: Tavily or SerpAPI, behind a swappable `SearchProvider`
- **Financial data**: SEC EDGAR (XBRL company facts, no key required) as the primary-filing
  source; Alpha Vantage or yfinance (>= 1.x - older releases are blocked by Yahoo) as the
  structured financial-API source
- **RAG (LangChain)**: long source documents are chunked (`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`),
  embedded locally (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, no API key/network call) and
  indexed in an ephemeral per-source FAISS store; the Claim Extractor retrieves the chunks
  most relevant to what the research plan actually asked about instead of a fixed-prefix cut
  — see `app/rag/indexer.py` and section 4 below
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector (Docker locally; Neon/Supabase when deployed), via
  SQLAlchemy with Alembic migrations. SQLite remains as a zero-setup fallback and for tests.
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, served from the FastAPI app's built `frontend/dist` bundle
- **Testing**: pytest, with a fully mocked end-to-end path (no live API dependency)
- **Deployment**: Docker / docker-compose

Every external integration sits behind an adapter interface so a provider can be swapped
(or entirely absent) without touching the core agent logic:

```
LLMProvider          SearchProvider         FinancialDataProvider
  |- GroqProvider       |- TavilyProvider      |- AlphaVantageProvider
  |- OpenAIProvider     |- SerpAPIProvider     |- YFinanceProvider
  (mock: see below)     |- MockSearchProvider  |- MockFinancialDataProvider
                                                (SEC EDGAR handled separately, primary-filing tier)
```

## Sign-in and Demo Mode

The site opens on a login page (`frontend/src/auth/LoginPage.tsx`). The page also explains
VeriFi using real data: it traces one company's revenue back to its NSE filings and the checks
behind it, and shows a live NSE ticker, both served by the public `GET /api/public/overview`.

- **Accounts** (`app/auth/`): email + password. Passwords are hashed with scrypt and a per-user
  salt. Sessions are random tokens in an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie, and only their SHA-256
  is stored. Repeated failed logins are throttled, and a wrong password and an unknown email get
  the same answer.
- **Demo mode**: "Explore in demo mode" opens a 2-hour guest session with no account. Guests see
  the full workspace with the same real data; "demo" means *no account*, never sample data. (The
  server's `DEMO_MODE` setting is a different thing: it serves an offline NSE snapshot, and the
  UI labels it "Offline snapshot".)
- **Enforced server-side**: every research and industry API returns 401 without a session. Only
  `/api/health`, `/api/public/overview` and `/api/auth/*` are public.
- Settings: `USER_SESSION_DAYS` (default 7), `DEMO_SESSION_HOURS` (2), `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`
  (set `true` behind HTTPS).

## Database: the source of truth

VeriFi delivers **verified financial information and documents**, with no market or trading
data. All of it lives in our own database, and every question is answered from the database
first. The source API is only contacted for what the database doesn't have yet, and whatever it
returns is stored.

**PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector.** Locally it runs in Docker as the `verifi-db` container on port
**5434**, so it doesn't clash with other local Postgres instances. When you deploy, point
`DATABASE_URL` at a hosted Postgres (Neon or Supabase, both free and both with pgvector); no
code changes. Alembic migrations (`migrations/`) own the schema and are applied automatically
on startup.

| Table | Holds |
|---|---|
| `companies` | Each company, and when its data was last checked against the source |
| `documents` | Every source document: quarterly results today; annual reports and IPO prospectuses next. Each row records its origin, filing date and checksum, so nothing is stored twice |
| `financial_facts` | **One row per number** (company, metric, period, value, unit), pointing to its document, with `origin` (xbrl / manual / pdf_extracted) and `verification_status` (verified / corrected / unverified). Every Number Has a Story: the story is these columns |
| `ingestion_runs` | An audit log of every sync and upload: what changed, and any error |
| `users`, `sessions` | Accounts (`role`: viewer or admin) and login sessions |
| `research_runs`, `sources`, `claims`, `evidence`, `verification_results`, `conflicts`, `reports` | The verified deep-dive pipeline |

**How a request is answered**, for the industry view (`app/industry/service.py`):
1. It is always computed from the database, in about 50 ms for all ten companies (three queries).
2. A company with nothing stored is fetched from the source first (first visit only), then stored.
3. A company whose data is older than `FILINGS_SYNC_HOURS` (default 12) is served from the
   database immediately while a background sync checks for new filings. The sync downloads
   only filings the database doesn't hold (`app/datastore/sync.py`).

Offline (`DEMO_MODE=true`) the source is never contacted, and the database is filled from
`sample_data/filings_seed/`, which holds real parsed filings.

**Management commands:**
```bash
docker compose up -d db                 # start the database (dev.ps1 does this for you)
python -m app.cli status                # what the database holds
python -m app.cli sync [--all]          # fetch new filings now
python -m app.cli make-admin EMAIL      # let a user upload and edit data
python -m app.cli import-sqlite [PATH]  # copy an old SQLite database in (safe to re-run)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "…"  # after changing app/storage/models.py
```

## Industry Dashboard (NIFTY IT)

The landing view compares India's ten largest listed IT companies (the NIFTY IT constituents)
on **reported financials only**: revenue, net profit, growth, operating and net margin, EPS, and
each company's share of industry revenue. It makes no LLM calls and uses no market data.

- **Source:** each company's consolidated quarterly results XBRL as filed with the exchange,
  stored in the database. Yahoo Finance was used originally and was dropped: its figures
  were stale, it omitted whole quarters, and it reported Infosys in USD.
- **Universe as data**: `sample_data/industries.json`. Adding an industry is a JSON edit.
- **Consistency checks** (`app/industry/analytics.py`), deterministic with no LLM:
  - The four quarterly filings of a fiscal year must add up to that year's annual figures.
  - Reported EPS must be consistent with net profit and shares in issue.
- **Filing corrections are shown, never hidden.** For example, Tech Mahindra's Dec-2025 filing
  tags owners' profit as Rs 198.7 Cr against its own total profit less minority interest of
  Rs 1,113.5 Cr. The accounting identity is applied, the fact is stored as `corrected` with
  the reason, and a note appears in the company panel.

API: `GET /api/industries`, `GET /api/industries/{id}[?refresh=true]`.

## IPO Centre

Upcoming and recently-listed **mainboard IPOs**, each with its full official report and a
search bar that answers questions strictly from that report - never from the LLM's general
knowledge, and never by estimating a figure the document doesn't state.

There is no reliable free API for Indian IPO prospectuses, so unlike the Industry Dashboard
(synced automatically from exchange filings), IPO data is **deliberately curated by hand**:
listing details and the full DRHP/RHP/report text are supplied by the team and stored via
`scripts/seed_ipo.py`, which upserts one IPO's row by `ipo_id` (safe to re-run as figures are
corrected or a new IPO is added). Every number shown traces to that stored report text - none
is scraped, inferred, or backfilled from memory.

**Schema** (`IpoORM`, `app/storage/models.py`): fixed, indexed columns for listing mechanics
(symbol, board, status, exchange, dates, price band, lot size, issue size, registrar, lead
managers) plus two freeform fields:
- `report_text` - the full report, stored verbatim. The *only* thing the Ask box is allowed
  to answer from.
- `payload` (JSON) - structured sections (financials, balance sheet, cash flow, order book,
  segment revenue, valuation, subscription, objects of issue, strengths, concerns, risk
  factors, verdict) that render as tabs on the IPO's detail page. A section's shape varies
  IPO to IPO, so the frontend renders each payload key generically (array of objects → table,
  array of strings → list, object → key/value grid) rather than hardcoding a fixed layout.

**The Ask endpoint reuses the research pipeline's RAG module** (`app/rag/indexer.py`, see
section 4) rather than a separate implementation: the same report chunking, local embeddings,
and FAISS similarity search used to pick relevant excerpts for the Claim Extractor is used
here to find the excerpt most relevant to the question asked, which the LLM is then
instructed to answer from *only* - stating plainly that the report doesn't mention something
rather than guessing. If no LLM is configured, the raw excerpt is shown instead of a
fabricated sentence, so the box is never silently wrong.

Two performance details worth knowing, since loading the embedding model is CPU-bound and can
take over a minute on a modest machine: it is warmed up once in a background thread at server
startup (`app/main.py`, alongside the existing industry-data background refresh) rather than
on the first real question, and the FAISS index for a given report is cached by a hash of its
text (`app/rag/indexer.py:_store_cache`) so a second question about the same IPO reuses it
instead of re-chunking and re-embedding the same document from scratch.

API: `GET /api/ipos[?board=mainboard]`, `GET /api/ipos/{id}`, `POST /api/ipos/{id}/ask`.

## 4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation

RAG is used specifically for **claim extraction from long source documents**, not as a
general architecture change. The problem it replaces: the Claim Extractor previously fed
the LLM the first ~3,500 characters of a source and silently discarded the rest - a filing
that discusses revenue early and risk factors later would never have its risk factors read
at all.

```
Source document (may be long)
        v
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (LangChain) - 600-char chunks, 80-char overlap,
        v                                     add_start_index=True so every chunk's
                                                offset in the original text is known
Local embeddings (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via langchain-huggingface)
        v                                     - no API key, no network call, doesn't
                                                share the LLM's rate-limited token budget
Ephemeral per-source FAISS index (langchain-community)
        v
similarity_search(query, k=6)  - query is built from the research plan's
        v                        requested_metrics / financial_questions / risk_questions,
                                  so retrieval is relevance-ranked against what THIS query
                                  actually asked about, not a generic summary
Top-k chunks, selected by similarity rank, then re-sorted into original
document order for a coherent excerpt
        v
Fed to the Claim Extractor's LLM prompt in place of a fixed-prefix slice
```

**Why LangChain here specifically, and not elsewhere in the pipeline:** LangChain owns the
parts it is actually built for - text splitting, embeddings, and vector search. Claim
generation and verification deliberately do **not** go through LangChain's LLM wrappers;
they use this project's own `LLMProvider` abstraction (`app/llm/`), because that is what
provides the guarantees the rest of the system depends on - strict Pydantic-validated
structured output, the token-bucket rate limiter with usage reconciliation (`app/llm/
rate_limiter.py`), and the retry/fallback-to-mock behaviour every extraction and
verification call relies on. Routing generation through a different framework's call path
would mean re-deriving all of that. This is a targeted integration, not a wholesale one -
and it is more defensible in that form: LangChain does what only it is well-suited for, and
nothing here duplicates infrastructure that already existed and was already tested.

**Evidence integrity is unaffected.** Retrieved chunks are exact, contiguous substrings of
`source.document_text` - `add_start_index=True` is what makes that provable, and it is
covered directly by `tests/test_rag_indexer.py::
test_retrieved_text_pieces_are_verbatim_substrings_of_the_source`. The Claim Extractor's
existing rule that a claim's quoted evidence must be located verbatim in the source
(`make_evidence`, see section 10 of the extractor's docstring) runs completely unchanged
against RAG-selected text - RAG changes what the model is shown, never how a claim's
evidence is checked afterwards.

**Scope, deliberately narrow.** The FAISS index is built fresh per source, per extraction
call, and discarded immediately after - it is not a persistent corpus, and chunking is
skipped entirely for a source short enough to already fit in one extraction call (`app/rag/
indexer.py:RAG_CHUNK_THRESHOLD`, 1,500 characters), so the (real, one-time-per-process)
embedding-model load cost is only paid when it buys something. If the RAG stack is
unavailable or a chunking/embedding call fails for any reason, extraction falls back to the
previous prefix-truncation behaviour rather than failing the whole pipeline
(`tests/test_rag_indexer.py::test_rag_failure_falls_back_to_prefix_truncation`).

## 6. Setup

The fastest path is the dev script - it creates the virtualenv, installs dependencies,
copies `.env.example` to `.env` on first run, starts the Postgres container if `DATABASE_URL`
points at one, and launches the backend with schema migrations applied automatically:

```powershell
.\scripts\dev.ps1     # Windows
```
```bash
./scripts/dev.sh      # macOS/Linux
```

Requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) running if
`DATABASE_URL` is a `postgresql://` URL (the default in `.env.example`) - the script starts
`docker compose up -d --wait db` for you, but Docker itself has to already be running. Without
Docker, set `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/financial_research_agent.db` in `.env` instead and
the app runs with zero external services.

To set it up by hand instead:

```bash
cd financial-research-agent
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env        # Windows: copy, macOS/Linux: cp
docker compose up -d --wait db   # only if DATABASE_URL is postgresql://
```

`requirements.txt` includes the RAG stack (`sentence-transformers` + `torch`), so first
install is a larger download (roughly 600MB-1GB) than a typical FastAPI project - a one-time
cost. The embedding model itself (~90MB) downloads once on first use and is cached locally
by HuggingFace afterwards; every run after that is fully offline for the RAG step.

The app runs **without any API keys** in DEMO_MODE (the default) - see section 9.

### Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for the full list. Key ones:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DEMO_MODE` | `true` forces deterministic mock providers everywhere (default) |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `groq` or `openai` |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` | LLM credentials |
| `LLM_TPM_LIMIT` | Optional tokens-per-minute budget; paces LLM calls instead of hitting 429s |
| `SEARCH_PROVIDER` | `tavily` or `serpapi` |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` / `SERPAPI_API_KEY` | Web search credentials |
| `ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY` | Optional; falls back to yfinance (no key) if unset |
| `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT` | Required by SEC's fair-access policy for EDGAR requests |
| `MAX_FOLLOWUP_ITERATIONS`, `MAX_RESEARCH_QUERIES` | Bounds on the follow-up research loop. Each extra iteration re-runs retrieval + extraction + verification, so `0` keeps runs fastest on a rate-limited tier |

## 7. Running Locally

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
docker compose up -d --wait db   # if DATABASE_URL is postgresql:// - see section 6
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

(`scripts/dev.ps1` / `scripts/dev.sh` do all of this in one command - see section 6.)

Open `http://localhost:8000` for the web UI, or `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the
interactive API docs.

If the backend can't reach the database, `uvicorn` will appear to hang right after the
Alembic log lines instead of failing fast - that almost always means Docker Desktop isn't
running. Start it, then run `docker compose up -d db` and retry.

For frontend-only development with hot reload, run the backend on port 8000 and then:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` requests to `http://localhost:8000`.

## 8. Running with Docker

For production hosting on Render (Blueprint, environment variables, database
seeding, troubleshooting), see **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

`docker-compose.yml` defines two services: `db` (Postgres 16 + pgvector, the usual way to run
it - see "Database: the source of truth" above) and `app` (the backend itself, optional -
most local development runs the backend directly with `uvicorn` instead, for `--reload`).

```bash
copy .env.example .env   # edit in real API keys if you have them, otherwise leave as-is
docker compose up -d db        # database only (the common case)
# docker compose up --build    # database + the backend, both containerized
```

The app is available at `http://localhost:8000`. Postgres data persists in the `verifi_pgdata`
Docker volume, independent of the containers themselves - removing a container never removes
the data. SQLite remains available as a zero-setup fallback (`DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///...`);
in that mode the database file lives at `./data/financial_research_agent.db`.

## 9. Demo Mode

`DEMO_MODE=true` (the default, and the automatic fallback whenever no LLM key is configured)
makes every provider use a deterministic, clearly-labelled mock implementation instead of a
live API call:

- Mock sources always have `source_type=mock` and `source_tier=mock`, and their
  `document_text` is prefixed with `[MOCK ... - DEMO MODE, NOT A REAL ...]`.
- Mock claim extraction uses real regex parsing over that mock text (not fabricated numbers) -
  every evidence span still points at real, stored text.
- Mock verification (`NumericMatcher` is always deterministic regardless of mode;
  `EntailmentChecker`'s mock path reuses the same numeric-matching logic for numeric claims
  and a text-overlap heuristic for qualitative claims).

**The system never presents mock data as if it came from a real SEC filing, web search, or
financial API.** As soon as real API keys are configured and `DEMO_MODE=false`, each provider
switches to its live implementation automatically (with mock as a safety-net fallback if a
live call fails, so one flaky API doesn't take down the whole run - the resulting source is
still tagged with its provider's normal tier, since it succeeded).

## 10. API

All endpoints below except `/api/health`, `/api/public/overview` and `/api/auth/*` require a
signed-in or demo session (see "Sign-in and Demo Mode").

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/answer` | Database-first: answers a question in milliseconds straight from stored, verified filings if VeriFi already holds the companies asked about; `answered: false` otherwise, with a `reason` the frontend uses to decide whether to fall back to full research |
| `POST /api/research` | Queues a research run; returns `202` immediately with a `research_run_id` (the pipeline runs in the background) |

### Example queries

```
Analyze Apple Q3 2024
Analyze Microsoft's revenue, profitability and major risks for FY2024
Analyze NVIDIA revenue and profitability
Compare Apple and Microsoft
```

The system is **company-agnostic**: company names are resolved dynamically via
`CompanyResolver` (backed by SEC EDGAR's public ticker directory when online, or a small
bundled sample directory in demo mode) - there is no `if company == "Apple"` branching
anywhere in the codebase.

## 11. Testing

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

59 tests covering the query planner, normalization, claim extraction (evidence-span
integrity), the numeric matcher, the entailment checker, conflict detection, confidence
scoring, report generation, the bounded follow-up loop, dedicated adversarial cases (wrong
number / wrong unit / wrong period / GAAP vs non-GAAP / quarterly vs annual), and one
fully-mocked end-to-end test through the real FastAPI app (no live API dependency).

## 12. Evaluation Harness

```bash
python -m evaluation.run_evaluation
```

Runs the hand-labelled evaluation sets (`evaluation/labeled_eval_set.py`,
`evaluation/conflict_eval_set.py`) through the real pipeline modules and writes
`evaluation/results/latest_report.json`. This is also wired into `pytest` as
`tests/test_evaluation_harness.py`, so the numbers below are re-measured on every test run,
never just claimed:

- **Citation verification coverage**: 100% (every claim in the eval set is run through the
  verification engine by construction)
- **Verification accuracy / Brier score / calibration curve**: computed from ~74 hand-labelled
  claim/evidence pairs across scenario types (exact match, scale-equivalent match, wrong
  number, wrong unit, wrong period, no-mention, qualitative support/no-support)
- **Conflict detection precision/recall**: computed from 15 hand-labelled claim-pair
  scenarios (genuine disagreement, basis mismatch, period mismatch, currency mismatch,
  within-tolerance agreement)

**Methodology note**: given the scope of an 8-week OJT project, this evaluation set is
constructed by the developers from parameterized scenario templates rather than independently
crowd-sourced - each scenario type deterministically implies its correct label by
construction (e.g. a "wrong_number" case is always CONTRADICTED), so the labels are
documented ground truth, not guesses. This makes the harness fully reproducible without any
external annotation effort, at the cost of not being a fully independent validation set - see
Known Limitations.

## 13. Confidence Scoring Methodology

Confidence is a transparent weighted sum of four independently-computable components
(`app/analysis/confidence_scorer.py`), never an LLM asked to "grade" its own claim:

| Component | Weight | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| `source_quality` | 0.25 | Source tier (primary filing 1.0 → aggregator 0.45 → mock 0.5) |
| `evidence_match` | 0.30 | How exactly the claim's value matches the evidence (exact / normalized / mismatch) |
| `corroboration` | 0.20 | How many *other* sources independently report a compatible value |
| `entailment` | 0.25 | The entailment checker's own confidence in its verdict |

`confidence` means **the system's confidence in its verification verdict**, not "how likely
the underlying fact is true" - a confidently CONTRADICTED claim (a caught error) scores highly
too, since the system is sure it caught it.

## 14. Retrieval vs Extraction vs Verification vs Conflict Detection vs Confidence Scoring vs Synthesis

These are five genuinely distinct pipeline stages, each with a narrow responsibility -
important for the viva:

1. **Retrieval** (`app/retrieval/`): fetches raw documents from external sources and stores
   them verbatim with provenance metadata. Never interprets or summarizes content.
2. **Extraction** (`app/extraction/`): reads a *single* source's raw text and pulls out
   discrete factual claims, each anchored to an exact character span in that source. Never
   compares across sources.
3. **Verification** (`app/verification/`): re-examines *one claim against its own source
   evidence only* (never the report, never other claims) via two independent paths - a
   deterministic numeric matcher and an LLM entailment checker - and produces a verdict.
4. **Conflict Detection** (`app/analysis/conflict_detector.py`): compares *already-verified,
   normalized* claims about the same entity+metric *across different sources*, and
   distinguishes a genuine disagreement from a period/basis/currency mismatch that merely
   looks like one.
5. **Confidence Scoring** (`app/analysis/confidence_scorer.py`): combines source quality,
   evidence match quality, cross-source corroboration, and entailment confidence into one
   transparent number per claim - it does not re-verify anything.
6. **Synthesis** (`app/generation/report_generator.py`): assembles the already-verified,
   already-scored claims into report sections. Every fact in the report is a direct rendering
   of a `Claim` object; the one LLM-assisted section (the executive overview paragraph) is
   constrained to only cite already-verified claims and its cited `claim_id`s are validated
   against the real claim set afterwards.

The critical isolation: **the Verification stage never sees the Synthesis stage's output.**
This is what prevents the "verifier grading its own homework" failure mode explicitly called
out in the PRD (section 5.1.4) - the entailment checker is given only a claim and its raw
evidence text, with no report context at all.

## 15. Known Limitations

- **Mock-mode data is generic**: in `DEMO_MODE`, mock financial figures are the same
  illustrative numbers regardless of which company was requested (no real API is being
  called), so a demo comparison between two companies will show identical mock figures for
  both. This is intentional and clearly labelled - it goes away the moment real API keys are
  configured.
- **Mock qualitative entailment cannot detect CONTRADICTED**: the deterministic mock
  entailment path for qualitative (non-numeric) claims only distinguishes SUPPORTED vs
  INSUFFICIENT (a text-overlap heuristic can't reliably detect semantic negation/contradiction
  without an LLM). With a real LLM key configured, the entailment prompt does support
  qualitative CONTRADICTED verdicts.
- **The evaluation set is self-constructed** (see section 12) rather than independently
  annotated; a 100% score on it demonstrates internal consistency and guards against
  regressions, not generalization to arbitrary unseen real-world text.
- **No FX conversion**: claims in different currencies (e.g. USD vs INR) are correctly
  detected as non-comparable and reported as an explained (non-genuine) conflict, but the
  system does not perform currency conversion to compare them directly.
- **Web-source tiering is a domain allowlist heuristic** (`app/retrieval/web_search.py`):
  a small set of well-known publication domains is promoted to `PRESS` tier; everything else
  defaults to `AGGREGATOR`, since a generic web search API gives no stronger reputation
  signal than the source domain.
- **SEC EDGAR / Alpha Vantage / yfinance coverage** depends on the company being a
  US-listed/SEC-registered entity with a resolvable CIK/ticker; non-US companies (e.g.
  Reliance Industries) will have gaps in primary-filing and financial-API coverage and rely
  more heavily on web search results, which the system surfaces transparently as fewer
  sources rather than failing.
- **IPO Centre data is manually curated, not synced**: there is no reliable free API for
  Indian IPO prospectuses, so unlike the Industry Dashboard, an IPO only appears once its
  listing details and report text are deliberately added via `scripts/seed_ipo.py`. The Ask
  box is only as complete as the report text it was given - a question about a detail the
  stored report doesn't cover is correctly answered "not mentioned," not guessed.

## 16. Observability

Every stage logs through Python's standard `logging` module under the `financial_research_agent.*`
logger hierarchy (configured in `app/main.py`, level via `LOG_LEVEL`): each research run's start
and completion (source/claim/conflict counts and the SUPPORTED/CONTRADICTED/INSUFFICIENT
breakdown), each retrieval batch's source count, each follow-up iteration, and any failure
(via `logger.exception`, with the full traceback but never a request payload or API key).
Structured `%s`-style fields (not string-concatenated messages) keep log lines easy to parse
or pipe into an aggregator. The codebase does not currently wire up actual OpenTelemetry
spans/exporters (the PRD lists this as "where practical," and for an 8-week single-process
project the log-based approach above already gives the same operational visibility) - the
logger boundaries above are exactly where OTel spans would be added first if this were
deployed as a real service.
